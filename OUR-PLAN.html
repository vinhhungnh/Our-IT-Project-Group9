                </h1>
                <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2" data-animation-name="fadeIn" data-animation-duration="1000" data-animation-delay="0"> Initially, we need to build the basic functionality as a foundation for the application to meet the essential needs of the users. In addition to basic functions like login and account registration, we need to build some key features like task planning and task scheduling. Specifically, the task planning feature allows users to set up a list of specific goals for each project. Moreover, users can customize them easily. Accordingly, they can do a quick add function to create new tasks. Users can also delete, replace or change the location easily thanks to the tools provided by the app.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>In terms of setting up, we will use AppyPie for coding to build apps conveniently because it supports both Android and iOS. Specifically, we will create a new project and share it with team members. It is also necessary to create a repository on GitHub to easily monitor and interact with project files. In terms of personnel, Kiet will take on the main role in this period, but during the working process, all members also need to observe and help each other.<br>
                  <br>Before we start coding, we need to do some research. Based on the resources that the team has provided in the planning section and additional resources, we will review similar applications available on the market. From there, identify and evaluate the common points as well as the specific strengths of different products with the goal of creating the most suitable product for all users. For the implementing part, once we understand how functions work, we'll start coding. Besides building, we need to make sure the code can run on both Android and iOS platforms smoothly. Code execution doesn't need to be absolutely perfect as we have a separate phase for later testing. The main goal of this phase is to build the most optimized code possible so that the team has an overall picture of the product. During the coding process, in addition to Kiet acting as the main developer, Kha will be responsible for observing and supporting. That's because Kha is responsible for the development of the AI feature, which is improved from the basic functions.

                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">To achieve the features of the application, our team will spend time researching and developing an AI that is able to distinguish between different tasks and knows how to separate big tasks into smaller ones. This will be our foundation step and is also the most difficult milestone that we have to accomplish for the project to be successful. It is impossible for us to train our AI to know everything about human works since there are tons of different jobs that humans could do. Therefore, we would start from the field that is the most related to us and has a lot of needs in scheduling which is education.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">First, the team will do research about effective learning methods to create learning patterns that can be easily followed and applied by students. There are a lot of classes and courses at schools and universities, and for different subjects, there will be different approaches to complete and achieve high grades. Hence, our team will try our best to identify as many subjects as possible and create numerous study paths to provide to students that study in different fields.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Then we would start developing our AI for the main features of the application. It will first have to learn the researched data about academic subjects and be trained to distinguish them. After that, we would teach the algorithm to perform planning for simple tasks such as homework, assignments, projects or test preparation. Function testings would continuously be conducted to examine how well the AI performed and for debugging.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">We will also create our database system and host servers to put our app and website online, as well as for collecting user data. When users make changes to the schedule that the program has provided, that log will be monitored and sent back to our servers. We will then analyze the behavior of our users and train our algorithm to fit them better.</span></b>

                <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-6" data-animation-name="fadeIn" data-animation-duration="1000" data-animation-delay="0"><b>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">As for the design, we want the interface of the application to be friendly and easy to use, which makes it easy for users to access and enjoy. To do that, this phase requires two basic steps: conducting user research and surveys and designing interfaces.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, as a front-end developer of our team, Hung will take responsibility in this stage. However, we will not work alone, instead, he will perform his tasks with the help of other team members. For the setting, we will use Google Forms to conduct surveys as well as some useful tools to design the app’s interface such as Adobe Photoshop and InVision App. Besides, we also use Visual Studio Code as the main IDE for developing the website that we use to post this report and description of our product.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Before setting up the layout for the interface, we will go through usability testing. The audience we want to target is everyone, but most typically students. Therefore, we need to conduct surveys with these subjects mainly. After receiving feedback from real users, we will begin to analyze and evaluate the needs and usability of the product. Then we will create a suitable prototype. The survey process may be repeated until the previously set objectives are satisfied.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, after having a general layout of the product, we will proceed to the next step which is to actually create the interface. Accordingly, the app’s interface will follow a simplified design for ease of use. Functionalities will be created and linked to the AI. To start scheduling, users will have to input the name of the subject (we will also provide a list of subjects that are available), which task they want to perform (homework, test, etc.) and the time range that the task will take place. Then, the app will generate a calendar from the start date to the deadline and when you select a date, it will tell you what to do on that day. Reminders and checklists will also be provided for users to keep better track of their progress. Students can also adjust their plans where they find it is inefficient or is an error.&nbsp;</span></b>

                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the last and not least important stage before we deliver the final product. The main goal of this phase runs the overall application to check and detect bugs and defects for improvement. At the same time, team members have the opportunity to give their opinions and feedback on different aspects of the project. They can be strengths that need to be worked on or weaknesses that need improvement in the future.</span></b>
                  <br>
                  <br><b>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of the testing sessions, everyone on the team will work together to consider if there are any mistakes or errors when using this app and if the app features work correctly or not. We will also conduct testing surveys with end-users to have practical knowledge as well as to detect more risks that are not expectedly defined in the plan. Meanwhile, during this process any bugs found and user feedback will be documented specifically. It helps us remember and avoid repeating mistakes in the future as well as creating convenience in case we need to review them later.&nbsp;</span></b>
